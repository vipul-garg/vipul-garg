### Hey! ðŸ‘‹
I am Vipul. I deliver Fintech solutions to Africa & Middle-East. My waves of curiority have led my to dive into Application Security, Web and API Development. I am currently gaining knowledge in Bug Bounty space with focus on APIs, Auth and Android Security. In the quest to understand the workings of this space I am diving further into Python, JS, React, Containers, Kotlin and list gets longer. 

Time, hence, is of essence; Collaboration is the need of the hour. With the recent break-throughs in AI and its impact on individual productivity, its excitng times ahead!

For any common interests, collaborations and conversations, I can be reached at vipulgarg79@gmail.com
